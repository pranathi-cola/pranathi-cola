- 👋 Hi, I’m @pranathi-cola
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, writing and music 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning verilog (gate level implementation) and C (Data Structures)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any coding projects. If I am being honest, I am a first year student and don't know much about coding. But, I want to improve my skills and develop myself. I hope I can learn more.
- 📫 You can mail me on pranathikola23@gmail.com or message me in instagram @murderisacoolhobby
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am working on a novel, I am proud of it but it needs work. Hope it works out well >_<
